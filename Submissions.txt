1. How many hours did you spend on this challenge?
    5 hours

2. Describe the features you have implemented.
    I implemented the following features:
    1) User selecting options - only one chosen at a time, hover effect, highlight selected option, user must go through all questions before submitting
    2) Show results - user can't edit after submission, results are shown in separate component based on options selected
    3) Retake quiz - allows user to retake the quiz

3. Describe the difficulties you faced (if any) while working on the challenge and how you tackled them.
    I had to think about how to store the answers in state and how to calculate the results.
    I also had to think about styling the quiz and making it responsive. I tackled these challenges by using lots of
    documentation and exploring different libraries.
